  <h1><a name="RXFActivator" id="Installation_of_Product"></a><a name="Setup"></a>Installation using the RXFActivator</h1>The
installation of an RXF by Willert Software Tools requires you to already
have the modeling tool&nbsp;Rhapsody installed.<br><br>A release of an RXF is delivered as ZIP-Archive. It contains all
framework files and the related tools, samples and documentation. You
should select a destination folder to unzip it where your user account
has read and write access.
We recommend to unzip it relative to your
IDE projects to be able to use it together with your configuration
management.<br><br>Once
the ZIP has been extracted, the framework is ready to be used.
But in most cases Rhapdody needs to be prepared to work together with the RXF. The RXF comes with
a small tool called RXFActivator, that performs the Rhapsody RXF integration for you.<br><br>From
the extracted RXF folder execute RXFActivator.exe, it will ask for
administrator rights that are needed e.g. to write to the registry. It
is a console application that will list all Rhapsody installations
found on your machine. All those Rhapsody versions can afterwards be
used with the RXF. The program can be exited by pressing any key after it has
finished.<br><br><img alt="Screenshot of the RXFActivator tool." src="Images/Shared/RXFActivatorTool.png"><br>
<h2><a name="Updating_Rhapsody"></a><a name="Rhapsody_Update"></a>Moving the RXF Folder and Installing new Rhapsody Versions</h2>You can move the RXF folder to any other location with read and write access, there is no need to re-execute the RXFActivator.<br>But you need to re-execute it after a new Rhapsody version has been installed.

<h2><a name="Installation_Problems"></a><a name="Setup_Problems"></a><a name="RXFActivator_Warnings"></a>Possible Problems During Setup</h2>
If you experience any problems, please first check the following possible solutions:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure you have the necessary read/write access privileges in the RXF and Rhapsody directories.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Make sure you have enough disk space available.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Only Windows 10 is the supported operating system.<br><br></li><li>If
you want to place the RXF on a "subst" mapped drive or on a network
drive, please make sure that the administrator account, executing the
RXFActivator sees the path to the RXF the same way your user sees it.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Sometimes&nbsp;long&nbsp;path
names may cause problems. If RXFActivator failed, you may retry it after
moving all RXF files to a directory on
your local drive with shorter paths&nbsp;(e.g. "C:\Willert\") and
launching RXFActivator.exe from there again.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>If
the RXFActivator experiences problems, it shall print warning or error
messages. If you need further help, please include the console output
of the RXFActivator and send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@willert.de">support@willert.de</a></li></ul>

<h2><a name="Uninstalling_the_RXF"></a><a name="Deinstallation"></a><a name="Removing_the_RXF"></a>Uninstalling the RXF</h2>

Basically all you need to do to uninstall the RXF is to delete its folder. <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 16.0016px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); display: inline ! important; float: none;">There is no new entry added to the Windows registry during installation.</span><br>
Regarding the Rhapsody modifications the RXFActivator also performs,
usually there is no need to undo it. However if you completely removed
all RXFs
from your computer you can follow the following steps to make sure the
RXF does not leave modifications in the Rhapsody installation:<br>
<ul>
	<li>In your Rhapsody "Share\Settings" or "UserShare\Settings" folder you shall find the subfolders "CodeCentric_Original" and 
	"SoftwareArchitect_Original". If that is the case, you may:
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>delete the subfolders "CodeCentric" and "SoftwareArchitect" and
		</li>
		<li>rename subfolder "CodeCentric_Original" to "CodeCentric" and
		</li>
		<li>rename subfolder "SoftwareArchitect_Original" to "SoftwareArchitect"
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>In your Rhapsody "Share\Properties" or "UserShare\Properties" folder edit the file SiteC++.prp
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>If it contains an environment enumeration literal "RXF" you may remove it, including the following comma (",").
		</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
