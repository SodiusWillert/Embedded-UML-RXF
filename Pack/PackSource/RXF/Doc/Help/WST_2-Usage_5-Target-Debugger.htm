UML Target Debugger - Usage Example</h1>
<p>The
Embedded UML Target Debugger is a product developed by Willert Software
Tools GmbH. It allows you to analyze the software behavior on your
target using UML Diagrams.
This is similar to a conventional high level language debugger, but on
UML level. Basically, the UML Target Debugger will write Sequence
Diagrams and Timing Diagrams from the information that the RXF
Framework on your target provides.<br>
Care has been taken to ensure that the influence on the real-time
behavior of the RXF is as minimal as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To
create the diagrams, the Target Debugger needs information. This
information is in the model and also in the generated source
code. Minimizing the influence on real-time behavior means: sending as
little information as possible from the target to the host. </p>
<p>The
Target debugger will read most of the symbolic information it needs
from an XML file that was generated during code generation. The user
does not have to do anything to do this, the RXF code generation will
do that automatically for you. The symbols used in the generated
diagrams are coded so that only small pieces of information must
be sent physically via the Target Debugger Communication channel.</p>
<p>This
communication channel is something that must be implemented when
adapting the Target Debugger to the user's environment. It can be
anything that can be used on target and host. Serial, TCP/IP, CAN, JTAG
or something proprietary.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This page will guide you through the first steps how to use
the&nbsp;Embedded UML Target Debugger.</p>
To be able to work with the Embedded UML Target Debugger and view the
target animation, &nbsp;please first go through the <a href="WST_2-Usage_3-Getting-Started-1.htm">GettingStarted
example</a>. We will extend this example to explain the target
Debugger.<br>
<br>
<h2>Basic Functionality - Getting Started with the Embedded UML
Target Debugger</h2>
For
the first steps with our Embedded UML Target Debugger, it is highly
recommended to use our example model instead of your own model.&nbsp;
<p>Basically, there are two things you need to configure:
animation
details (what info is needed) and the Target Debugger Communication
channel
(how is physically communicated). For this, you'll need some
stereotypes which have tags used for configuration. These stereotypes
are located in the package RXFMonitor.
</p>
<p>We will use <a name="Blinky_UML_Sample_Model_with_Animation" id="OORTXAnimationDemo_Rhapsody_Sample_Model"></a>Blinky.rpyx,
which is a good starting point.<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
</span><br>
<br>
In your Rhapsody Model make sure that the RXFAnimation stereotype
is set on your active component or Configuration.<span style="font-style: italic;"></span> This will trigger
the code generator to generate the needed XML file and also the
necessary extra code.<br>
<br>
Additional you need to set an RXFMonitorIO_* Stereotype to select the
communication channel you want to use to transmit Data between the
Target and the UML Target Debugger. In this example the ITM channel is
selected by using the Stereotype RXFMonitorIO_CortexITM. If no
applicable Communication Stereotype is available for which supports
your device, please contact Willert Support: <a href="mailto:support@willert.de">support@willert.de</a><br>
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<img alt="" src="Images/Shared/TD/BlinkyMonitorStereotypes.png">
</p>
<p> After setting these Stereotypes&nbsp; some additional
Tags will be added to your Component / Configuration. <br>
This is shown in the picture below. </p>
<p> <img alt="" src="Images/Shared/TD/BlinkyMonitorTags.png">
<br>
The Subject "RXFAnimation" contains general settings for the Monitor.
The
Subject "RXFMonitorIO_*" contains settings for the selected
communication
channel between Target and UML Target Debugger. It can contain additional
settings depending on the communication type selected. For example port
number
for a TCP/IP connection or message ID for a CAN connection. Here are
some of the used tags with a description:<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>AnimationType: You can choose between RXF_FULL_ANIMATION <span style="font-weight: bold;">(default)</span>&nbsp;and
RXF_TRACE_ANIMATION.</li>
<ul>
<li>FULL:&nbsp; Split the information of an Event into
three packages<br>
1. Event is put into the message queue<br>
2. Event consumption start<br>
3. Event consumption end</li>
<li>TRACE: Event information is send to UML Target Debugger
in one package at event start to avoid overhead.</li>
</ul>
<li>MaxParallelStates:
This numeric value should represent the count of parallelStates of the
statechart with the most parallel states. If this number is to
large unnecessary data is sent to the UML Target Debugger. If this
number is to small there is the possibility of losing data. You can
find
out the number of parallel States by checking the count of state
attributes of the class which has the suffix "_active". <span style="font-weight: bold;">(Default: 4U)</span></li>
<li>sendParameters: Switch on/off of sending event / operation
parameter. <span style="font-weight: bold;">(Default: Yes)</span></li>
<li>MaxPrintIntObjects:
Number of filtered instances which can send integer values to the UML
Target Debugger. (This feature will be described more in detail). If
you do not need this functionality you can switch it of by setting the
value to 0. <span style="font-weight: bold;">(Default: 0)</span></li>
<li>MonitorTaskStackSize:
The monitor uses a task to send / receive data. This Tag can be used to
define the stack size of the monitor task. <span style="font-weight: bold;">(Default: 1024U)</span></li>
<li>MonitorTaskName: Name of the monitor task.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">(Default: "MonitorTask")</span></li>
<li>MonitorReceiveCommandBufferSize:
Maximum size of a command which can be handled by the monitor when
receiving a command from the UML Target Debugger. 32U should be
sufficient as long as you don't want to inject events with a huge
amount of parameter data.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">(Default:
32U)</span></li>
<li>MonitorSendBufferSize: Buffer to
collect data while your application is running which are send to the
UML Target Debugger when the monitor task is active.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> (Default: 1024U)</span></li>
<li>MonitorReceiveBufferSize:
Buffer which stores received data from the UML Target Debugger which
are handled inside the monitor task.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">(Default: 32U)</span></li>
</ul>
<br>
Make sure you have an empty GettingStarted IDE&nbsp;project you can
deploy to. (If the GettingStarted is not empty, there is a IDETemplateProject that should be empty, just copy and rename it).<br>
You can now perform a Generate/Make/Run in Rhapsody. This will generate
code, generate the RXF files and start the deployer. Select the
GettingStarted Project (Or the project you just copied) and the
deployer
will deploy the Rhapsody generated files to your IDE, and build the <a href="WST_2-Usage_3-Getting-Started-1.htm">GettingStarted
example</a>.
<p><a name="Uml_Target_Debugger_ITM" id="Uml_Target_Debugger_ITM"></a>You may encounter an
error message at link time, <i>... Symbol ITM_RxBuffer multiply
defined</i> </p>
<p> <img alt="" src="Images/Shared/TD/ITMmultipleDefined1.png">
</p>
<p> In this case you must deselect ITM being used for STDOUT as
ITM is used by the monitor: </p>
<p> <img alt="" src="Images/Shared/TD/ITMmultipleDefined2.png"></p>
<p> After a successful build in your IDE, flash the executable to
the
target<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
but do not start program execution yet!</span> The target program
must
be reset and stopped. Otherwise, the Embedded UML Target Debugger will
miss important information about dynamically created objects the target
sends.<br>
<br>
Now start the&nbsp;Embedded UML Target Debugger on
the PC. Launch the batch file
located under &lt;RXF installation
Path&gt;\RXF\Tools\TargetDebugger\Embedded_Uml_Target_Debugger.bat.<br>
<br>
The Embedded UML Target Debugger first need to read the <a name="XML_file_for_animation" id="XML_file_for_animation"></a>XML
file which has been generated&nbsp;using a
simplifier helper during Rhapsody's code generation. This file is
called &lt;Component&gt;_&lt;Configuration&gt;.xml and
created next to your model. You can open the XML file using <span style="font-style: italic;">File | Open XML File</span>
or via button on the toolbar.
</p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: </span>Instead
of launching the Target Debugger via batch file you can alternatively
open it from Rhapsody's "Tools" menu. That gives you the advantage that
it also
automatically loads the XML file for the active configuration in
the Target Debugger.
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Shared/TD/BlinkyStartTDViaRhapsodyTools.png">
</p>
<p><a name="Target-Debugger-Start" id="Target-Debugger-Start"></a>
After the &lt;Component&gt;_&lt;Configuration&gt;.xml
file was opened, you have to select the target
communication plugin you want to use from the drop-down list by
clicking on the IO plug-in selection button:
</p>
<p></p>
<table border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center" valign="top"><img src="Images/Shared/TD/BlinkyTDSelectComPlugin1.png"> </td>
<td align="center" valign="top"><img src="Images/Shared/TD/BlinkyTDSelectComPlugin2.png"> </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> After selecting a plugin a configuration window will pop up
to config the communication with the target.<br>
<img alt="" src="Images/Shared/TD/BlinkyTDSetUvisionComSettings1.png">
</p>
<p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Important for
this plugin before press OK:</span> </p>
<ul>
<li>make sure that uVision is already running because this
plugin will connect directly to uVision. </li>
<li>the port number must match the port used by uVision and
UVSOCK must be enabled. Verify in uVision via the menu <i>Edit |
Configuration... | Other</i>
<p> <img alt="" src="Images/Shared/TD/BlinkyTDSetUvisionComSettings2.png"> </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
After confirming the plugin with "OK" a console message should appear
that the plug-in is initialized successfully.
</p>
<p>In retrospect it is always possible to change the
communication plugin and settings by using the toolbar buttons.<br>
</p>
<p>Now&nbsp;switch back to your IDE. Build the deployed
sources and
start program execution on target, as the Embedded UML Target Debugger
now listens
for commands sent from target. In the tree view on the left you can now
also see values of attributes and states.<br>
You will see something like this:<br>

<h2>Explaining the GUI</h2>


<h3>The Menu</h3>
This area contains short cuts to the most common functions of the UML
Target Debugger.<br>
The same functions can be found in the tools menu. <br>
<h3>The Browser Area</h3>
The browser Area is split into three parts:<br>
<br>Objects:<br>
After the Target Debugger is started, the XML file is loaded and the
communication channel was setup and started, the target can start
sending information.
<br><br>Views:<br>
The view tab manages your recorded / loaded sessions.<br>
You can generate / edit views on your recorded data.<br>
This means you can filter your recorded data by event information
(sender / receiver / event type )<br>
Additional you can save and load such filter views.<br>
Open a selected view in a separate window to compare it with another
view.<br>
You can save a selected view to your computer to share it with colleges.<br>
You can save a selected view as *.csv file.<br>
<br>Target:<br>
This tab give you control about the target filter.<br>
This means you can select while runtime which events and instances are
send from your Target to the UML Target Debugger.<br>
This can be very important when your model becomes very big and you
have to separate which information is send to the UML Target Debugger
to avoid a buffer overflow on target side.
<h3>The Diagram Area</h3>
This area shows your selected view as sequence or timing diagram.<br>
<h3>Console</h3>
The Console window shows information on actions you perform to get a
feedback of what you did.<br>
<br>
<br>
This is the "normal" functionality of the Target Debugger.
There is much more, the following chapters explain (briefly) some of
the more advanced features.
<h2>Advanced Features</h2>
<br>
You can also click on an attribute / state:
at that moment in runtime, the Embedded UML Target Debugger on the PC
will query the target to send the actual value - such information is
sent only on request by the PC in order to reduce the I/O traffic as
much as possible. The information shown on events is actually
transferred in a compact way and not as the strings you see, again to
reduce traffic and thus runtime disturbance. The Request for the
attribute value / state is send to the target when you collapse the
item
in the tree view.<br>
<h3>Timing Diagrams</h3>
The Embedded UML
Target Debugger is able to switch from the default sequence diagram
view to a timing diagram view. It is a useful diagram similar to the
timing diagrams known from technical data sheets to visualize state
changes proportional to the time axis.
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Shared/TD/BlinkyTDtimingDiagram.png">
</p>
<p>Zooming in and out is possible using the mouse wheel, if
available. You
can change the start tick by dragging inside the diagram with mouse or
by using the Zoom control below the timing diagram.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="Event_Injection_via_Embedded_UML_Target_Debugger" id="Event_Injection_via_Embedded_UML_Target_Debugger"></a>Event
Injection</h3>
It is
also possible to inject events by the Embedded UML Target Debugger to
stimulate a specific behavior on the target side.
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Shared/TD/BlinkyTDinjectEvent1.png"><br>
<br>
Clicking this button will activate another Window: </p>
<p> <img alt="" src="Images/Shared/TD/BlinkyTDinjectEvent2.png"> </p>
<p> To inject an event, you just select the event name, a
destination object
an press on Inject Event. Alternatively, you can add an event to a
sequence to inject more than one event at the same time.<br>
<br>
<a name="Events_with_Parameters"></a>Events
may also have standard type
parameters, which are supported by the Embedded UML Target Debugger.
Parameters / arguments of events will be displayed as integer values
inside the animated diagrams. Also, event injection with arguments is
possible. If you have selected to inject an event which has parameters
(defined in the UML model), a window will pop up and ask for each
argument. The value for each argument will be insert as unsigned int
value and cast internally to the real data type of the event parameter.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="Filtering_for_Specific_Instances_in_the_Embedded_UML_Target_Debugger" id="Filtering_for_Specific_Instances_in_the_Embedded_UML_Target_Debugger"></a>Filtering</h3>
On
a larger model, showing all events and attributes is confusing, because
it will not fit in a window and will lead to overhead. Therefore, we
have implemented a filter mechanism on the target side which can be
controlled at runtime / compile time. <br>
Change filter while runtime:<br>
Please
select the Target tab. Here you find a list of all reactive Objects. By
enable / disable the depending instance the filter will be switched on
/ off on the target side.
<p> <img alt="" src="Images/Shared/TD/BlinkyTDfilter.png">
</p>
<p> Setup Filter while compile time:<br>
If you want to activate the filter while compile time, please use
following properties: (hint: select the desired element like a class
and inspect its Properties using the Filter: Send) </p>
<p> <img alt="" src="Images/Shared/TD/BlinkyTDcompileFilter.png"> </p>
<p> Please use <span style="font-weight: bold;">RXFMonitor::Class::SendEventsToTargetDebugger</span>
for classes. This means that all instances of this class will be
filtered on target side.<br>
Please use <span style="font-weight: bold;">RXFMonitor::Relation::SendEventsToTargetDebugger</span>
for Parts or Compositions. This is usefull if you have more than one
instance of a class and only want to see the behavior of special
instance.<br>
<br>
If you set both values on "unchecked" for your active configuration,
all instances are filtered on the target.<br>
</p>
<h3>Communication Buffer Overflows</h3>
When
an event is consumed by the user application, event information is sent
to the UML Target Debugger. This information is stored inside a buffer
which is send to the UML Target Debugger inside a monitor task. If the
user application takes too much execution time and the monitor task has
no chance to send the content of the buffer to the UML Target Debugger
the buffer will overflow at some point. If this happen event
information is lost and a buffer overflow command is send to the UML
Target Debugger to indicate the user that data has been lost.&nbsp;<br>
