<h1>Getting Started Example - Part 3</h1>

If you inspect the Scope of various components, you will notice that for RTOS based configurations, 
code is generated for the entire model. But for the OORTX, which does not support 
<a href="WST_3-Technology_1-Concurrency.htm">active classes</a>, the package active is disabled:<br>
<br>
<div align="center">
Scope for Blinky with RTOS<br>

Scope for Blinky with OORTX<br>

</div>
<p>
The name of a component is free to choose, but it is a good idea to use
the same name as the configured RTOS, so a user of this model
immediately recognizes for which environment a component is meant.
The RXF is released for multiple environments; the property
RXF::DeployerFolders::RTOS on the active configuration shows all
supported environments.
</p><p>
A Deployer is used to deploy Rhapsody generated source files from your model, generated configuration files and RXF source files
to your IDE project, where you can build an executable or library. </br>
If you select the Properties tab of a component, you can select the RTOS and IDE details easily in the RXF perspective:
</p><p>

<br>
Results in:<br>
<br>

</p><p>
The IDEProject must be set to the IDE project file where you build your executable or library.
<br/>
You do not need to tell the Deployer which kind of IDE project
is selected. The Deployer recognizes the IDE project by the suffix and
content of the IDE project file and internally selects the correct IDE
exporter.<br/>
The <a href="WST_2-Usage_4-Deployment.htm">Deployer tab is described in detail in a dedicated section</a>.
