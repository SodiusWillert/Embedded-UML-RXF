  <h1><a name="High_water_marks" id="High_water_marks"></a>High Water Mark mechanism</h1>

A high water mark mechanism can be used to finetune the configuration of your memory pools.<p>
These pools are used to allocate dynamically objects: objects derived
from your classes but also events. If an event has parameters, the
resulting event structure is larger. </p><p>
A highwater mark is a counter which is incremented when another block is allocated from a pool and never decremented: 
it shows how much a pool has been used so far. All event memory pools have such a mechanism: 
memoryPool_Event_default, memoryPool_Event_small, memoryPool_Event_medium and memoryPool_Event_large

</p><p>
Depending on the <a href="WST_2-Usage_4-Configuration.htm#Configuration_Memory_Pools_Tab">configuration of the memory pools</a>,
there are multiple pools. All pools are statically allocated in a
generated RXF_Event.cpp and each pool consists of a number of blocks.
You can configure the size of a block and the number of blocks in a
pool. If you configure the block count to zero, that pool is not
allocated.
</p><p>
At runtime, you can inspect the pools with a debugger. Per allocated pool, there is a member
</p><ul>
	<li>count. This is the actual value.
	</li>
	<li>maxCount. This is the highwater mark: when count is increased, this maxCount is increased.</li>
</ul>If a loggging is required, the highwater mark values can be
requested by calling getMaxCount() on a specific Memory Pool instance.<br>
