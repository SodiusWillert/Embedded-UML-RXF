Willert Software Tools GmbH has gone through great effort to adapt the
code in the RXF to make it MISRA C++ 2008 compliant. If your application
must be MISRA compliant, you must set up your own MISRA compliance
process, which can be based on our product, your model and project
specific MISRA&nbsp;documents and procedures. This should at least
include:<br><ol><li>A compliance matrix, which shows how compliance has been enforced.&nbsp;</li><li>All of the&nbsp;code in the product is compliant with the MISRA rules or is subject to documented deviations.&nbsp;</li><li>A
list of all instances of rules not being followed is maintained, and
for each instance there is an appropriately signed-off deviation.</li><li>The following issues have been addressed in the development team:&nbsp;

      <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Training&nbsp;</li><li>Style guide&nbsp;</li><li>Compiler selection and validation&nbsp;</li><li>Checking tool validation&nbsp;</li><li>Metrics&nbsp;</li><li>Test coverage<br></li></ol>
    </li></ol>

  <br>
In the sources of the RXF, excluding those of the Container Classes,
you will find code comments, which refer to MISRA rules. These MISRA
suppression comments use macros to be able to support different tools
for MISRA compliancy checking. Some tools can be adapted to
recognize these macros as specific rule suppression comments while for
other tools such as PC-lint the macros need to be replaced by tool
specific suppressions first.<br>

Please contact our sales department at +49 5722 9678 60 for any
questions or inquiries for acquiring our MISRA&nbsp;specific documents
and procedures.<br><h2>MISRA Settings / Profiles</h2>The
RXF profile implies MISRA improvement properties, which are
automatically used when the RXF is used. The details of the overridden
MISRA-related properties can be reviewed via the file
"RXF\Profiles\Rhapsody\Properties\MISRA.prp".<br><br>In
addition our RXFStereotypesCpp profile offers stereotypes that can be used in the user model
to make e.g. an operation suppress some MISRA rule(s) in their body or
specification, set up via tags.<br><br></div><p id="Footer">This documentation belongs to the Product RXF_CPP_V8.0.1, released on 2022-03-14. (c) 2022, Sodius Willert</p>
